# Accounting for Agricultural Credit

Financial institutions account for loan receivables by recording the amounts paid out and owed to them in the asset and debit accounts of their general ledger. This is a double entry system of accounting that makes a creditor’s financial statements more accurate.

A loan receivable is the amount of money owed from a debtor to a creditor (typically a bank or credit union). It is recorded as a “loan receivable” in the creditor’s books.

Like most businesses, a bank would use what is called a “Double Entry” system of accounting for all its transactions, including loan receivables. A double entry system requires a much more detailed bookkeeping process, where every entry has an additional corresponding entry to a different account. For every “debit”, a matching “credit” must be recorded, and vice-versa. The two totals for each must balance, otherwise a mistake has been made.

There are three kinds of accounts:

Real accounts relate to the assets of a company, which may be tangible (machinery, buildings etc.) or intangible (goodwill, patents etc.)
Personal accounts relate to individuals, companies, creditors, banks etc.
Nominal accounts relate to expenses, losses, incomes or gains.

## Accounting Entries for Loan receivables

When you issue a loan note to a borrower, it is treated as an asset, which, if receivable under a year, is a current asset. In your book, CR your bank account, and DR asset account – Note receivable – with the amount advanced to the borrower.

On receipt of an agreed interest from the Notes, you DR your bank account and CR the interest income account ( to the income statement)

## Additional Entries For Loan Receivables:

For the provision of the loan receivable – CR provision account and DR bad debt account.

For loan written off during the year – DR provision account ( if there was an initial provision) or bad debt and CR loan receivable account.

## Accounting Entries for Loan Payable

If on the other hand, you received a loan from a bank, the amount payable is treated as a liability, which could be short or a long term. To record loan payable, CR liability account & DR bank account with the amount received from a lender.

All interest and principal paid on the loan periodically will be treated as thus: CR your bank account and DR loan payable account with the amount calculated.

## Accounting Treatment For Convertible Loan

Convertible loans stock is a type of debt the owner can convert to a specified number of shares in a company. Instead of paying an interest on this debt, you can opt for a dividend. In your book, such transactions are treated as thus: If it’s loan payable, DR loan payable account and CR equity share with the number of equity shareholding after applying a conversion ratio. But, for loan receivable CR loan receivable (asset) and DR investment account.
