### Own your farm

Register your farm to access free market information.

The main purpose of Agri24 is to give farmers easy access to information on current market conditions. Ordering market reports is free for farmers who own or rent land. Companies that want to do market research will in future be able to take out subscriptions to obtain information on land values. It is therefore important to register your own farms to obtain the free information.
