### How to start

The first step is to find your farm on our map. There are two ways to search for farms:

1. **Search for an officially registered farm name** by entering a keyword in the search box.
2. **Identify the farm on the map**, and click on it with the mouse on the correct land.

Find out how to <Link href="/farms/claim-your-farm"><a href="/farms/claim-your-farm">register a farm</a></Link>.

If you want to share the farm you found with someone, it's easy to share the <Link href="/farms/share-farm-information"><a href="/farms/share-farm-information">location and details</a></Link>. Maybe you want to show your family what the farm you all grew up has become, or perhaps you want to show a customer the location of your farm.

Once you have found your farm, it is important to register the farm as your own. Once you have registered properties, you can then order a <Link href="/farms/order-market-report"><a href="/farms/order-market-report">market report</a></Link> or order <Link href="/farms/order-farm-valuation"><a href="/farms/order-farm-valuation">professional farm valuation</a></Link> through us.
