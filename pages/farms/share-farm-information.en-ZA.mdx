### Share farm information

Sharing farm property with others is easy. You can share information of a farm property using social media or simply sending an email with a link. 

After you have <Link href="/farms/claim-your-farm"><a href="/farms/claim-your-farm">found your farm</a></Link>, you can share the farm information by selecting the farm property on the map, then click "Share map".

Then either copy the link or use one of the social media buttons to share the link.
