All fields that are compulsory are highlighted in green. On the Contact form you'll see that the Name field is compulsory.

You can now capture all contact details you have.

### Company groups

In most cases, farm operations are a collection of legal entities that operate together. They way this is managed on Agrista is called company groups.

You'll see a dropdown box for the company group. From this drop you can then select a company group the new contact belongs to. If you are creating a new contact, save your new contact, and then edit it again to specify that your new contact is the main entity in the farming group.
