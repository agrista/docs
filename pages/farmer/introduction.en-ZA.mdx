The first step is to find your farm on our farm map. There are two ways to find your farm:

1. **Search for an official registered farm name** by entering a search string in the the search box.
2. **Identifying your farm on on the map** by clicking on the map using your mouse.

Learn how to [register your farm](/farmer/claim-your-farm).

If you would like to share the farm information on the map, you easily do so by [sharing your farm location](/farmer/share-farm-information). Maybe you'd like to share a link with family members to show the farm you grew up on, or you could for instance share the farm details with a client of yours.

As soon as you have found your farm, it is important to claim the farm as your property.
